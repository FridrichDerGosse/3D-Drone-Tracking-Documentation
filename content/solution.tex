\section{Hardware}

\subsection{Computer}

\begin{itemize}
	\item NVIDIA Jetson Nano: too expensive and focuses on AI-Power
	\item ASUS Tinker Board S: not enough processing power?
	\item ArmSom Sige7: Good value, good processing performance
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Camera}

When choosing the ArmSom Sige7, we reviewed their other hardware to guarantee compatibility, rather than relying on third-party components. We found that they provide a 4K camera module that is fully compatible and reasonably priced.

\subsection{Display}

We found that ArmSom offers a 10.1-inch Full HD display that is fully compatible and reasonably priced.

\subsection{Calibration}

For calibration the main station can rotate its head (camera, laser, communication) in 2 axes
- Precise ToF Laser with enough range (30 meter at least)
- Use Radio-Com hardware for approximate direction determination

Calibration/start-up procedure:

- Calibrate C-axis stepper (end-switches)
- Calibrate B-axis servo (check max rotation with gyro)
- Move motors to neutral position
- Connect with other stations (all stations in neutral position)
- Get 3d magnetic orientation of every station
- Find estimate directions by sweeping and checking RSSI
- Measuare exact distance and direction (2 axes) with ToF Laser
- Move all cameras to perfect position for best maximum coverage in air (only if secondary stations can do that)
- Calculate exact relative positions/angles of cameras.
