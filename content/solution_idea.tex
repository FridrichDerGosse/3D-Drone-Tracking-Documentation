\section{Hardware}

\subsection{Computer}

Compare boards online (power for image processing needed)

\subsection{Camera}

Compatible (with single board computer), good value camera. 4k would be good (for higher distance tracking)

\subsection{Display}

Search for compatible Full HD 8-12 inch display for a reasonable price

\subsection{Power Supply}

USB-C input
Battery-powered
Power-Supply on PCB for all components

\subsection{Data Transfer}

- Local radio communication (could double for approximate direction determination for calibration)

\subsection{Calibration}

PCB to connect everything (with Arduino for the things our Image Processing Unit is not capable of doing)
- PCB will also integrate Power-Supply

PCB:
- Power Delivery
- ToF Laser
- Communication
- Stepper
- Servo
- Gyro/Mag/Acc 9DOF
- End switch

With 40pin cable to Computer and/or with extra Chip
