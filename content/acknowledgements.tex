\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

We would like to express our deepest gratitude to our supervising teachers, MMag.{}^{a} \textnormal{ Egger Eva-Maria, MA}, Dipl.-Ing. Götsch Leopold, PMM and Mag. \ phil.\ Jank Andreas}, for their invaluable guidance, insightful feedback, and unwavering support throughout the development of this thesis.

We are also profoundly thankful to our families, especially our parents, for their continuous support, both emotionally and financially, which has made it possible for us to pursue our education at this institution. Living away from home during the week in a  student dormitory, due to the significant distance from our school, has presented its own set of challenges.

Lastly, we extend our appreciation to our classmates, especially Reiter Matteo, and friends who have been a source of inspiration and assistance throughout this project.
