\section{Detailed Task Description}

Main goal: Track drones with multiple ground stations

\subsection{Hardware}

\subsubsection{Computer}

\textbf{Responsible:} Krahbichler Lukas

Select hardware capable of efficiently handling the required image processing and running the 3D-GUI.

\subsubsection{Camera} % This heading is not Tracking because we chose to use a camera for tracking in advance

\textbf{Responsible:} Krahbichler Lukas

Select, procure, and set up a suitable camera.

\subsubsection{Display} % The goal of this is to make the system interactable and user-friendly. As we chose to program a 3D-Visu with Ursina in Python in advance the heading is "Display" rather than "User-Interface" or something similar

\textbf{Responsible:} Krahbichler Lukas

Select and integrate a display for visualization, ensuring compatibility with other hardware components.

\subsubsection{Power Supply}

\textbf{Responsible:} Krahbichler Lukas

Design or select a power supply system that meets the requirements of all hardware components to ensure stable and efficient operation.

\subsubsection{Data Transfer}

\textbf{Responsible:} Krahbichler Lukas

Select and test a secure and fast communication medium for data transfer between the stations.

\subsubsection{Calibration}

\textbf{Responsible:} Krahbichler Lukas

Select and integrate calibration hardware essential for precise positioning and synchronization of the stations.

\subsection{Housing}

\textbf{Responsible:} Prantl Niclas

Design, test, and build housing for the primary station and secondary stations, incorporating all components.

\subsection{Programming}

\subsubsection{Development Environment}

\textbf{Responsible:} Prantl Niclas

Ensure a consistent and efficient development setup.

\subsubsection{Hardware Drivers}

\textbf{Responsible:} Prantl Niclas

Develop a modular and reliable driver system.

\subsubsection{3D Angle Calculations}

\textbf{Responsible:} Prantl Niclas

Develop algorithms to calculate drone positions based on data from the stations.

\subsubsection{Camera Tracking}

\textbf{Responsible:} Krahbichler Lukas

Implement software to track drones within the camera's output stream.

\subsubsection{Data Transfer}

\textbf{Responsible:} Krahbichler Lukas

Develop and implement a system to synchronize data transfer from secondary stations to the main station.

\subsubsection{Calibration}

\textbf{Responsible:} Krahbichler Lukas

Create software to perform calibration procedures, accurately calculating relative positions and rotations of the stations.

\subsubsection{3D Visualization}

\textbf{Responsible:} Prantl Niclas

Program a 3D visualization interface to display tracked drones, integrating data from all stations.
